# Overview 

[A Walk Through Time](https://sharpryan20.github.io/ci-project-one/index.html) is my Portfolio 1 project. It is a site that promotes and highlights the joys and passions of nature with an added twist of history mixed into it. My target audience are people who enjoy long nature walks, whether that's through fields, forests, mountains. I aim to have a little bit of everything for everyone. 

The site is fully responsive and laid out in a minimal manner to present users with informational trail choices, and enough information to make choices without being misled on what they are looking at. The site is generated through html. I was originally given a brief of a project before I started or had the option to come up with my own. I decided to challenge myself and completely come up with an original idea and that is how 'A Walk Through Time' was created. The scope of the project does not include any back-end functionality, so whilst there is a form on my page, the information entered into the fields will not feed anywhere. 

# UX

The primary goal with the sites UX, in terms of UI, was to ensure the design was a sleek and simple design, almost minimalist, which helps unclutter and not overload the audience with information and overwhelm them. 

From the beginning in the early development stage with planning the wireframes of the website my goal was to have my images as a main focal point. To enforce that from the first interaction, I decided to have a full page image of a forest, which immediately gives the audience the feel of what the website is entailing. The landing page holds little to no information except for a couple of buttons which takes the customer to other parts of site.

## First Time Visitor Goals:

- As a first time visitor I need to able to navigate the site easily and clearly understand how to use the function of the site.
- I want to be able to see a clear list of trails, along with important details about each trails that is being offered.
- I want to quickly be able to find contact details if I need help with booking or facing bug issues.

## Returning Visitor Goals:

- I want my email address saved so filling in the form will be quicker in future.
- I want the experience to remain consistent and continue to find information about new and upcoming trails that the business is offering.
- I perhaps want to contact the site owner to make a suggestion.
