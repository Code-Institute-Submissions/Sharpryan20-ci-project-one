# Overview 

[A Walk Through Time](https://sharpryan20.github.io/ci-project-one/index.html) is my Portfolio 1 project. It is a site that promotes and highlights the joys and passions of nature with an added twist of history mixed into it. My target audience are people who enjoy long nature walks, whether that's through fields, forests, mountains. I aim to have a little bit of everything for everyone. 

The site is fully responsive and laid out in a minimal manner to present users with informational trail choices, and enough information to make choices without being misled on what they are looking at. The site is generated through html. I was originally given a brief of a project before I started or had the option to come up with my own. I decided to challenge myself and completely come up with an original idea and that is how 'A Walk Through Time' was created. The scope of the project does not include any back-end functionality, so whilst there is a form on my page, the information entered into the fields will not feed anywhere. 

# UX

The primary goal with the sites UX, in terms of UI, was to ensure the design was a sleek and simple design, almost minimalist, which helps unclutter and not overload the audience with information and overwhelm them. 

From the beginning in the early development stage with planning the wireframes of the website my goal was to have my images as a main focal point. To enforce that from the first interaction, I decided to have a full page image of a forest, which immediately gives the audience the feel of what the website is entailing. The landing page holds little to no information except for a couple of buttons which takes the customer to other parts of site.

## First Time Visitor Goals:

- As a first time visitor I need to able to navigate the site easily and clearly understand how to use the function of the site.
- I want to be able to see a clear list of trails, along with important details about each trails that is being offered.
- I want to quickly be able to find contact details if I need help with booking or facing bug issues.

## Returning Visitor Goals:

- I want my email address saved so filling in the form will be quicker in future.
- I want the experience to remain consistent and continue to find information about new and upcoming trails that the business is offering.
- I perhaps want to contact the site owner to make a suggestion.

# Design:

## Typography

- I used different styles of font for different elements in my site. My main logo font is lobster and it helps make it stand out from any other text on the site.

- My Headings for all of my pages use a font called 'Caveat'. I chose this font because it is easy to read and it makes it clear that the headings are the introduction to every page.

- Any other text that was used throughout the site has a font of 'roboto' and I chose this font because it looks very modern and again is easy to read.

## Colour Scheme 

![design](assets/images/readme-images/palette.png)

- The site's primary colours are green, cream, black and white. The above image shows the original colour section for the site, the primary colour was the green. All colours were picked and matched from [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/).

- The reason for my colour palette was to try and resemble nature as much as possible and the dark green really worked well with the type of images that I used. I then decided on a cream colour for the logo text and nav bar because it really contrasted with the green and made it easier to read for someone who may have difficult with seeing colours.

## Layout:

- As mentioned earlier, the site is deliberately minimal with what is showcased to provide easy access and to stop over clutter. I chose to use images to bring colour and to help break up the text on some of the pages. 

- Information about the business and the owners are presented as cards which enlarge when hovered over. The cards go from being side by side to being on top of eachother depending on the size of the user's device.

- Information about the trails that the website showcases work similar to the information cards about the company. However the audience will need to first hover over their preffered trail and only then will it bring up inofrmation about the type of trail they are interested in.

- In the future I would like to be able to have the cards about the trails to size in column size depending on the user's screen size. 

# Wireframes 

Below will be attached of all my wireframes. These were very basic mockups of how I intended my website to look from the beginning.

### Index.html 

![Index-Page](assets/images/readme-images/index.png)

My original plan as can be seen above was to have separate boxes on the home page which provided information and small catch phrases to draw in the target audience. However, throughout development I settled down on the idea that the home was more of a welcome page to the target audience. The only service it would have would be to help navigate people throughout the rest of the site.

### Trails.html 

![Trails-Page](assets/images/readme-images/trails.png)

When designing my trails page, my original plan was to have images floating left and right going all the way down the page, which a box either to the left or right of them depending on where the image was explaining about each of the trails. However, during development, I decided to have just the images first and then the information would be displayed when the user hovers over them.
